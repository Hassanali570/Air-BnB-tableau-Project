Due to the File size issue of the Data set I am linking the link of the website from where you can esily download and use the updated dataset. "https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/"

In this project I have used dataset of Air BnB's from there official website and using Tableau I have demonstrate some analysis on the data set such as Revenue per year, price by zip code and Average price per bedroom etc. Then created a complete Dashboard that completely show up the all analysis.
